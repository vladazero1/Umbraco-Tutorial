					<p class="intro">The end of 2019 is approaching and with this, also the last Product Update of the year. 
						And what a year it has been - especially when we‚Äôre talking ‚Äúproduct‚Äù! Two major product launches with Umbraco 8 and Umbraco Heartcore. 
						2019 also saw a record-breaking amount of PRs submitted, mainly due to a record-shattering Hacktoberfest üôå 
						It‚Äôs absolutely amazing to see how much Umbraco 8 has evolved in the past 10 months, not least thanks to the friendly and very productive Umbraco community. 
						I cannot wait to see what happens in 2020! 
						But, before we get to that, let‚Äôs have a look at what we‚Äôve been working on and what you can expect in the near future.</p>
					<br />
					<h3>New Release: Forms API & Content Filtering for Umbraco Heartcore</h3>
					<p>December 17th, we released two new features for our headless saas offering, Umbraco Heartcore; Form API and Content Filtering.
						<br /><br />
						<span class="font-weight-bold">Forms API</span><br />
						You‚Äôll find that the REST API has been expanded to include forms created with Umbraco Forms. 
						This means you can create forms (contact forms, questionnaires etc.) directly in the backoffice, 
						complete with conditionals and validation, and get all you need to render these forms in your presentation layer. 
						All you need to do is include a form on a content node using the Form Picker and you‚Äôll see the form data necessary 
						to render the form as part of the JSON response - you can also retrieve forms independent of content. 
						This also includes endpoints for posting form entries, so they will be stored in your Heartcore project and can utilise multi-step workflows.
						<br /><br />
						<span class="font-weight-bold">Content filtering</span><br />
						The REST API also includes a new endpoint for content delivery that lets you do more advanced filtering. 
						Previously, if you wanted to filter content based on a search term, you could utilise the search endpoint. 
						This is still possible, and useful, but if you want to be more precise and filter the content server side before it‚Äôs returned, 
						the new filter endpoint might be what you‚Äôre looking for. Let‚Äôs say you only want to retrieve content of a specific 
						Document Type that contains a specific phrase in a specific property.</p>
					<br />
					<h3>What's new on Umbraco Cloud</h3>
					<p>If you have an organisation set up on Umbraco Cloud, you‚Äôll find that the overview of projects and members of an organisation has been 
						given an overhaul to provide you with a better overview. This is done in line with the overall brand ‚Äúmake-over‚Äùof the 
						Umbraco Cloud portal which we released in November. You‚Äôll now see easy access to the different views for your organisation in a menu on the left.</p>

					<br />
					<h3>Upcoming Release: Umbraco Deploy 3.3</h3>
					<p>As mentioned in previous Product Updates we have been working on an improved Partial Restore feature for 
						Umbraco Cloud making it a breeze to get existing projects up and running with real content. 
						This feature is now complete and undergoing the last round of testing. <br />

						We aim to release this on January 7th with a new minor version of Umbraco Deploy. <br />
						
						From this date, all existing projects on Umbraco Cloud can get this by upgrading Umbraco Deploy on the project page and 
						all new projects will be running the latest version of Deploy when it is released. 
						This release will be for version 8 and we‚Äôll release this functionality for version 7 projects as soon as it‚Äôs backported and tested.</p>
